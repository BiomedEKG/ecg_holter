This directory contains sources for the WFDB library.  Please look at the
README file in the directory above this one before installing the WFDB library.

If a `make' utility is available, follow the instructions in 'Makefile' to
compile and install the WFDB library on your system.  If you do not have a
`make' utility, you will have to perform the installation manually; the
comments in 'Makefile' may be helpful in determining how to proceed.

For information about using the library, see the WFDB Programmer's Guide (TeX
source in the `doc' directory at the same level as this one).

The following files will be found in this directory:

COPYING.LIB	the GNU Library General Public License
Makefile	`make' description file for compiling the WFDB library using
		 ANSI/ISO standard C compilers on supported platforms
Makefile.top	Used by ../configure to construct Makefile (comments only)
Makefile.tpl	Used by ../configure to construct Makefile (portable section)
README		this file
annot.c		WFDB library functions for annotations
calib.c		WFDB library functions for signal calibration
ecgcodes.h	ECG annotation codes
ecgmap.h	ECG annotation code mapping macros
signal.c	WFDB library functions for signals
wfdb-config.c	mini-app to print WFDB library version and linking information
wfdb.h		WFDB library constant, structure, and function interface
		 definitions (created from wfdb.h0 by ../configure)
wfdb.h0		template for wfdb.h
wfdbinit.c	WFDB library functions wfdbinit, wfdbquit, and wfdbflush
wfdbio.c	Low-level I/O functions for the WFDB library
wfdblib.h	External definitions for WFDB library functions (created from
		 wfdblib.h0 by ../configure)
wfdblib.h0	template for wfdblib.h

What next?
----------

Once you have installed the WFDB library, read the `README' file in the `app'
directory on the same level as this one for instructions on compiling and
installing the standard WFDB applications.
